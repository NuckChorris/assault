A simple customizable battery indicator ported to as many WMs, docks, and
platforms as possible.

## Is it pretty?
I'd say so, though I'm a tad biased.

## Customizable
Almost everything is configurable.  You can change the size of the battery, the
size of the lightning bolt, the size of the text, the colors, even down the size
of the peg on the side.

## Does it work with my WM?
Maybe.  Assault currently has support for the following Window Managers, Docks,
and Bars:
 * WindowMaker DockApp
 * lxpanel
 * AwesomeWM (coming soon)

*Is your WM not listed here?  File a
[feature request](https://github.com/NuckChorris/assault/issues/new) or fork it
and send a [pull request](https://github.com/NuckChorris/assault/pulls)*

## Installation
1. Read the manual for your Window Manager, Dock, or Bar.
2. Don't pester me.
3. Maybe I'll eventually add `INSTALL.md` files to each folder.
